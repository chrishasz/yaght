# yaght

*Yet another Github Template* is a Github-friendly personal Jekyll theme for developers, based on the default [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.

I built yaght with a goal of simplifying the process, for developers, of getting a personal site off the ground. Basic things like multiple page templates to control the layout, to critical SEO optimization for reach, and automated integration with Github.
