Yet another Github Template (yaght) is a Github-friendly personal Jekyll theme for developers, based on the default minima theme.

this is primarily designed for GitHub pages.

I built yaght with a goal of simplifying the process of getting a personal site off the ground. When I first decided to create a website, my biggest concern was how to set up all of the necessary 3rd party integrations necessary to have a rich integration with the rest of the web.

The Goal is a simple template that would automatically provide features like multiple blog and page templates to control the layout, easy setup of critical SEO optimization for reach, and automated integration with your GitHub projects. I have always liked the simplicity of [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) but wanted more robust blogging features, additional page templates, and GitHub integration.

Basic things like multiple page templates to control the layout, to critical SEO optimization for reach, and automated integration with Github. It is also the theme that powers this website.
