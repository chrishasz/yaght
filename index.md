Yet another Github Template (yaght) is a Github-friendly personal Jekyll theme for developers, based on the default minima theme.

I built yaght with a goal of simplifying the process of getting a personal site off the ground. Basic things like multiple page templates to control the layout, to critical SEO optimization for reach, and automated integration with Github.
